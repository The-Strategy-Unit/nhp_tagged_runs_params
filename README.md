# nhp_tagged_runs_params

A Quarto document deployed to Posit Connect that runs on schedule.

Generates and [pins](https://pins.rstudio.com/):

* a list containing the model params for each NHP scheme's latest [tagged run](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/tagged_runs)
* a data.frame of metadata associated with those tagged runs

This makes it easier and faster to ingest params data into products like the mitigators-comparison app, for example.

You can access on Posit Connect the [params pin](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/content/32c7f642-e420-448d-b888-bf655fc8fa8b/) and the [metadata pin](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/content/811dbaf9-18fe-43aa-bf8e-06b0df66004e/) if you have sufficient permissions.
