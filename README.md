# nhp_tagged_runs_params

A Quarto document [deployed to Post Connect](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/tagged-runs-params/) that runs on schedule.

Generates and [pins](https://pins.rstudio.com/) a list containing the model params for each NHP scheme's latest [tagged run](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/tagged_runs).

This makes it easier and faster to ingest params data into products like the mitigators-comparison app, for example.

The pinned object can be [accessed on Posit Connect](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/content/32c7f642-e420-448d-b888-bf655fc8fa8b/) if you have sufficient permissions.
